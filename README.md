## Latest Update: 4/10/2021 ##
- Added missing documentation for properties.
- Static and non-static methods now have improved documentation.
- Renamed file to JzSense
- Fixed methods reporting wrong return type.
- Fixed constructors w/ default values.
# ‚ö† Heads up ‚ö† 
##### The current version of JzSense is still a Work-In-Progress project. 
- The current version does not include `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object`, `Date`, `Function`, and `JSON`, and others later explained.
- JzSense only includes information directly from the [Daz Documentation website]. **There are more methods, properties, enums, signals available not included in here.**
- JzSense comes with billions of errors. This is perfectly fine. If it bothers you, you may need to disable JS vailidation errors.

# How to use 
###### ‚ö†  The following instructions is for Visual Studio Code  ‚ö†
1.  Download the `JzSense.js` script and import it into your workspace.
2.  If you haven't made a `.dsa` DzScript (ASCII) script yet, go ahead and do so.
3.  After creating a `.dsa ` file, go to the bottom-right of the screen where you see the current language. At default, you will see `Plain Text` . Click on it and a Language Dialog will pop up.
4.  Select "Configure File Association for `.dsa" and then select JavaScript as your mode.

If you open a folder/workspace, make sure that the file is in your working directory/workspace. 

If you have created a new file (or opened a file) rather than a folder or workspace, you need to import the script using syntax like: `import * as _ from "./JzSense.js"`
##### Optional
###### Disable JavaScript validation errors.
5.  Go to File -> Preferences -> Settings. In the User tab (or Workspace) select TypeScript (TypeScript is the interpreter for JavaScript & TypeScript for VS Code). Search for `JavaScript > Validate: Enable` and disable JavaScript validation.

## Planned Updates

   - Update functions with (currently) void return type when it should return their class type. ‚ùî
- Fix overloaded methods not showing. ‚úÖ
- Update JSDOC for classes. 
- Arrays will no longer return "any[]" (this has to be done manually afaik for 333 instances ._.)
