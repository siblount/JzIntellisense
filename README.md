# ⚠ Heads up ⚠ 
##### The current version of JzIntellisense is in its early stages.
- The current version does not include signals as of yet.
- The current version does not include the `Global`, `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object`, `Date`, `Function`, and `JSON`.
- The current version has a few enums missing.
- JzIntellisense comes with billions of errors. This is perfectly fine. If it bothers you, you may need to disable JS vailidation errors.

# How to use 
###### ⚠  The following instructions is for Visual Studio Code  ⚠ 
1. -Download the `JzIntellisense.js` script and import it into your workspace.
2. - If you haven't made a `.dsa` DzScript (ASCII) script yet, go ahead and do so.
3. - After creating a `.dsa ` file, go to the bottom-right of the screen where you see the current language. At default, you will see `Text File` . Click on it and a Language Dialog will pop up.
4. - Select "Configure File Association for `.dsa" and then select JavaScript as your mode.

##### Optional
###### Disable JavaScript validation errors.
5. - Go to File -> Preferences -> Settings. In the User tab (or Workspace) select TypeScript (TypeScript is the interpreter for JavaScript & TypeScript for VS Code). Search for `JavaScript > Validate: Enable` and disable JavaScript validation.
